# Investigation Methodology - Quick Start Guide

**For:** Instructing AI tools to investigate codebases
**Methodology:** See `INVESTIGATION_METHODOLOGY.md` for full details

---

## TL;DR - Copy & Paste Template

Use this template to instruct any AI tool:

```
I need you to investigate a codebase module using the iterative investigation
methodology described in [HELPERS_DIR]/methodology/INVESTIGATION_METHODOLOGY.md.

TARGET MODULE: [path/to/module]
OUTPUT LOCATION: [path/to/output]
OUTPUT FORMAT: [single_file | multiple_files | directory_structure]
HELPERS DIRECTORY: [path/where/helpers/go]  (e.g., helpers/investigations/[MODULE_NAME]/)

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
[Describe the sections/files you want]

FOCUS AREAS:
- [Area 1]
- [Area 2]
- [Area 3]

Follow the methodology exactly:
1. Create all helper documents in the specified HELPERS DIRECTORY
2. Work through all investigation phases
3. Document everything in INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md
4. Track progress in REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
5. Keep INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md updated for handovers
6. Synthesize final documentation at the end

This is an iterative process - update helper documents as you go.
```

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Single File Output

```
Use helpers/methodology/INVESTIGATION_METHODOLOGY.md to investigate:

TARGET: src/dotfiles/modules/template_renderer
OUTPUT: docs/template_renderer.md

HELPERS DIRECTORY: helpers/investigations/template_renderer/

SECTIONS:
1. Introduction & Overview
2. Architecture & Design
3. API Reference
4. Usage Patterns
5. Integration with Container Manager
6. Security Considerations
7. Troubleshooting
8. Examples

FOCUS:
- Jinja2 template handling
- Placeholder validation
- Integration points
- Error handling

Create helper documents and produce comprehensive documentation.
```

### Example 2: Multiple Files Output

```
Use helpers/methodology/INVESTIGATION_METHODOLOGY.md to investigate:

TARGET: src/dotfiles/modules/colorscheme_generator
OUTPUT: docs/colorscheme_generator/
FORMAT: Multiple files
HELPERS DIRECTORY: docs/investigations/colorscheme_generator/

FILES:
- architecture.md (design patterns, structure)
- api_reference.md (all classes and methods)
- usage_guide.md (patterns and workflows)

- examples.md (complete examples)
- troubleshooting.md (common issues)

FOCUS:
- Pywal integration
- Color extraction algorithms

Create helper documents and produce all output files.
```

### Example 3: Directory Structure Output

```
Use helpers/methodology/INVESTIGATION_METHODOLOGY.md to investigate:

TARGET: src/dotfiles/cli
OUTPUT: docs/cli/
FORMAT: Directory structure
HELPERS DIRECTORY: .investigation/cli/

STRUCTURE:
docs/cli/
├── README.md (overview)
├── architecture/
│   ├── command_structure.md
│   ├── config_system.md
│   └── plugin_system.md
├── commands/
│   ├── install.md
│   ├── configure.md
│   └── update.md
├── guides/
│   ├── getting_started.md
│   ├── configuration.md
│   └── extending.md
└── reference/
    ├── api.md
    └── troubleshooting.md

FOCUS:
- CLI command structure
- Configuration management
- Plugin architecture
- User workflows

Create helper documents and produce all documentation files.
```

## Customization Examples

### Focus on Security

```
Use helpers/methodology/INVESTIGATION_METHODOLOGY.md to investigate:

TARGET: src/dotfiles/modules/secrets_manager
OUTPUT: docs/secrets_manager.md
FORMAT: Single file
HELPERS DIRECTORY: helpers/investigations/secrets_manager/

EMPHASIS:
- Security considerations (detailed)
- Encryption methods
- Key management
- Threat model
- Best practices

ADDITIONAL PHASES:
- Phase 11: Security Audit (6 tasks)
- Phase 12: Compliance & Standards (4 tasks)

Standard phases + security-focused additions.
```

### Focus on Performance

```
Use helpers/INVESTIGATION_METHODOLOGY.md to investigate:

TARGET: src/dotfiles/modules/file_processor
OUTPUT: docs/file_processor.md
FORMAT: Single file

EMPHASIS:
- Performance characteristics
- Optimization strategies
- Benchmarking approaches
- Resource usage
- Scalability

ADDITIONAL SECTIONS:
- Performance benchmarks
- Optimization guide
- Resource limits
- Caching strategies
```

### Minimal Investigation (Quick Overview)

```
Use helpers/INVESTIGATION_METHODOLOGY.md to investigate:

TARGET: src/dotfiles/utils/helpers.py
OUTPUT: docs/helpers_reference.md
FORMAT: Single file

SIMPLIFIED PHASES (6 phases, 30 tasks):
1. Structure & Organization (5 tasks)
2. Function Reference (5 tasks)
3. Usage Patterns (5 tasks)
4. Examples (5 tasks)
5. Integration (5 tasks)
6. Validation (5 tasks)

This is a smaller module - use simplified phase structure.
```

## Handover Example

If investigation is interrupted, the next AI can continue:

```
Continue the investigation started in helpers/.

Read helpers/INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md for current status.
Check helpers/REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md for progress.
Review helpers/INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md for findings so far.

Pick up from the current task and continue following the methodology.
```

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific About Output
- Clearly define sections/files wanted
- Specify level of detail
- Mention any special requirements

### 2. Highlight Focus Areas
- What's most important?
- What can be skipped?
- Any domain-specific concerns?

### 3. Customize Phases
- Add phases for special topics
- Remove irrelevant phases
- Adjust task counts

### 4. Set Expectations
- Mention if it's a large/small module
- Indicate complexity level
- Note any time constraints

### 5. Provide Context
- How module fits in larger system
- Known issues or concerns
- Existing documentation to reference

---

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Full Investigation
- All 10 phases
- 50 tasks
- Comprehensive output
- Use for: Core modules, complex systems

### Pattern 2: Quick Reference
- 6-8 phases
- 30-40 tasks
- Focused output
- Use for: Utility modules, helpers

### Pattern 3: Deep Dive
- 12-15 phases
- 60-75 tasks
- Extensive output
- Use for: Critical systems, security-sensitive

### Pattern 4: Update Existing
- Focus on changes
- 4-6 phases
- Incremental output
- Use for: Updating old documentation

## That's It!

You now have:
1. **INVESTIGATION_METHODOLOGY.md** - The complete methodology
2. **INVESTIGATION_QUICK_START.md** - This quick reference

Just copy a template from this guide, customize it, and hand it to any AI tool!
