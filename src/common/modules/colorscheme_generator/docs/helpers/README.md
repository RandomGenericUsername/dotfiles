# Investigation Helper Documents

This directory contains helper documents for the systematic investigation of the `colorscheme_generator` module.

## Purpose

These documents support an iterative, AI-assisted investigation methodology that enables:
- **Progress Tracking** - Clear visibility into what's done and what's next
- **Session Handovers** - Any AI can pick up where another left off
- **Comprehensive Documentation** - Organized findings ready for final documentation
- **Quality Assurance** - Ensures all aspects of the module are thoroughly documented

## Helper Documents

### 1. `README.md` (This File)
**Purpose:** Explains the investigation system to AI tools

**Use this to:**
- Understand the helper document structure
- Learn how to use each document
- Get started with continuing the investigation

### 2. `INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md`
**Purpose:** Entry point for AI sessions - the handover document

**Use this to:**
- Understand the current investigation status
- See what task is currently being worked on
- Get context for continuing the investigation
- Know what to do next

**Structure:**
- **Static Section** - Never modified, explains the methodology
- **Dynamic Section** - Updated each session with current status and next steps

### 3. `REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`
**Purpose:** Task tracking with phases and completion status

**Use this to:**
- See all investigation phases and tasks
- Track progress (❌ Not Started | 🔄 In Progress | ✅ Complete)
- Identify what needs to be done next
- Monitor overall completion percentage

**Organization:**
- 10 phases covering all aspects of the module
- 5-6 tasks per phase
- ~53 total tasks
- Progress indicators for each task

### 4. `INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md`
**Purpose:** Repository of all discoveries and findings

**Use this to:**
- Record detailed findings as you investigate
- Store code examples and patterns
- Document architecture diagrams (ASCII)
- Capture usage patterns and integration points
- Build the knowledge base for final documentation

**Structure:**
- Table of contents
- Sections for each investigation area
- Code examples with explanations
- Architecture diagrams
- Usage patterns
- Integration points
- Troubleshooting information

### 5. `SESSION_SUMMARY.md`
**Purpose:** Summary of accomplishments in each session

**Use this to:**
- Record what was accomplished in each session
- Track key discoveries
- Note files created or modified
- Document next steps for future sessions

## Workflow for Continuing Investigation

### Step 1: Read INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md
Start here to understand:
- Current investigation status
- What phase/task you're on
- Recent accomplishments
- What to do next

### Step 2: Check REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
Review the checklist to:
- See overall progress
- Identify the next task to work on
- Understand what's already complete

### Step 3: Investigate & Document
For each task:
1. Investigate the codebase (use codebase-retrieval, view tools)
2. Document findings in `INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md`
3. Update task status in `REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` (❌ → 🔄 → ✅)
4. Update `INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md` with current status

### Step 4: Update Session Summary
At the end of your session:
1. Update `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` with accomplishments
2. Update `INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md` with context for next session
3. Mark completed tasks in `REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`

### Step 5: Synthesize Documentation
When investigation is complete:
1. Review all findings in `INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md`
2. Organize into final documentation structure
3. Create comprehensive documentation files
4. Validate completeness against checklist

## Investigation Phases

The investigation is organized into 10 phases:

1. **Architecture & Structure Understanding** - Map structure, identify files, understand organization
2. **Core Abstractions Deep Dive** - Document abstract base classes, interfaces, design contracts
3. **Type System & Data Models** - Document enums, dataclasses, type relationships, validation
4. **Exception Hierarchy** - Map exceptions, document error handling patterns
5. **Implementation Details** - Document concrete implementations, utilities, internal APIs
6. **Key Features & Capabilities** - Identify unique features, document how they work
7. **Integration & Usage Patterns** - Common patterns, integration points, workflows
8. **Advanced Topics** - Security, performance, extensibility considerations
9. **Documentation Synthesis** - Create diagrams, organize findings, prepare final output
10. **Validation & Review** - Verify completeness, validate examples, final checks

## Quick Start for AI Tools

If you're an AI tool picking up this investigation:

1. **Read this file** to understand the system ✓ (you're doing it!)
2. **Open `INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md`** to see current status and next steps
3. **Check `REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`** to see what's done and what's next
4. **Start investigating** the next task
5. **Document findings** in `INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md`
6. **Update progress** in all relevant helper documents
7. **Repeat** until investigation is complete

## Notes

- Always update helper documents as you work
- Keep `INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md` current for handovers
- Document discoveries immediately in `INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md`
- Mark tasks complete in `REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` as you finish them
- Update `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` at the end of each session
