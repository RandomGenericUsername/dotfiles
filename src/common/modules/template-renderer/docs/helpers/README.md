# Investigation Helper Documents Guide

**Investigation Target:** `template_renderer` module  
**Created:** 2025-10-18  
**Purpose:** Guide for AI tools to understand and use the investigation helper documents

---

## Overview

This directory contains helper documents that support the systematic investigation of the `template_renderer` module. These documents enable:

- **Progress Tracking** - Clear visibility into what's been investigated
- **AI Handover** - Any AI can pick up where another left off
- **Organized Findings** - Structured repository of all discoveries
- **Session Continuity** - Context preservation across sessions

---

## Helper Documents

### 1. README.md (This File)
**Purpose:** Explains the investigation system to AI tools  
**When to Read:** First thing when starting or resuming investigation

### 2. INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md
**Purpose:** Entry point for AI sessions - tells you what to do next  
**When to Read:** At the start of every session  
**Structure:**
- **Static Section:** Never changes - explains the methodology
- **Dynamic Section:** Updated each session - current status and next steps

### 3. REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
**Purpose:** Complete task list with status tracking  
**When to Update:** After completing each task  
**Format:** ‚ùå Not Started | üîÑ In Progress | ‚úÖ Complete

### 4. INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md
**Purpose:** Detailed findings repository  
**When to Update:** Continuously as you discover things  
**Content:** Code examples, architecture diagrams, usage patterns, integration points

### 5. SESSION_SUMMARY.md
**Purpose:** Record of what was accomplished  
**When to Update:** At the end of each session  
**Content:** Tasks completed, key discoveries, files created/modified, next steps

---

## Workflow for AI Tools

### Starting a New Session

1. **Read INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md** - Get current status and next task
2. **Check REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md** - See overall progress
3. **Review INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md** - Understand what's been discovered
4. **Start investigating** - Work on the current task

### During Investigation

1. **Investigate the codebase** - Use codebase-retrieval, view, etc.
2. **Document findings** - Add to INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md immediately
3. **Update checklist** - Mark tasks as üîÑ In Progress or ‚úÖ Complete
4. **Update prompt** - Keep INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md current

### Ending a Session

1. **Update SESSION_SUMMARY.md** - Record accomplishments
2. **Update INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md** - Set context for next session
3. **Save all changes** - Ensure continuity

## Investigation Phases

The investigation is organized into 10 phases:

1. **Architecture & Structure Understanding** (5 tasks)
2. **Core Abstractions Deep Dive** (5 tasks)
3. **Type System & Data Models** (6 tasks)
4. **Exception Hierarchy** (6 tasks)
5. **Implementation Details** (6 tasks)
6. **Key Features & Capabilities** (5 tasks)
7. **Integration & Usage Patterns** (5 tasks)
8. **Advanced Topics** (5 tasks)
9. **Documentation Synthesis** (5 tasks)
10. **Validation & Review** (5 tasks)

**Total:** 53 tasks

## Output Location

**Final Documentation:** `src/dotfiles/modules/template_renderer/docs/`  
**Format:** Directory structure with separate directories for each aspect

Expected structure:
```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md (overview/index)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ guides/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reference/
```

---

## Quick Start

**If you're an AI starting this investigation:**

```
1. Read INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md
2. Check what phase/task you're on
3. Investigate that specific aspect
4. Document findings in INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md
5. Update REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
6. Update INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md for next session
```

**If you're an AI continuing this investigation:**

```
1. Read INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md (Dynamic Section)
2. Continue from where the last AI left off
3. Follow the same workflow as above
```
