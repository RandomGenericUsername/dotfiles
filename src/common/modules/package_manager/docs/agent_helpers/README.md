# Package Manager Investigation - Helper Documents

**Investigation Target:** `src/common/modules/package_manager`  
**Output Location:** `src/common/modules/package_manager/docs/`  
**Format:** Directory structure with separate files for each concept  
**Created:** 2025-10-19

---

## Purpose

This directory contains helper documents for the systematic investigation of the `package_manager` module. These documents support an iterative, AI-assisted investigation process with handover capabilities.

---

## Helper Documents

### 1. **README.md** (This File)
Overview of the investigation system and how to use these helper documents.

### 2. **INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md**
**Purpose:** Entry point for AI sessions - provides context for continuing investigation

**Structure:**
- **STATIC SECTION:** Never modified - explains the investigation approach
- **DYNAMIC SECTION:** Updated each session with current status, tasks, and next steps

**Use this:** When starting a new AI session or handing over to another AI

### 3. **REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md**
**Purpose:** Track all investigation tasks and progress

**Contains:**
- Investigation phases (10 phases)
- Specific tasks for each phase (50+ tasks total)
- Status indicators: ‚ùå Not Started | üîÑ In Progress | ‚úÖ Complete
- Overall progress percentage

**Use this:** To see what's done and what's next

### 4. **INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md**
**Purpose:** Repository of all detailed findings

**Contains:**
- Architecture documentation
- API reference details
- Code examples
- Usage patterns
- Integration points
- Troubleshooting information

**Use this:** To record all discoveries during investigation

### 5. **SESSION_SUMMARY.md**
**Purpose:** Summary of accomplishments in each session

**Contains:**
- Tasks completed
- Key discoveries
- Files created/modified
- Next steps

**Use this:** To track session-by-session progress

## Investigation Workflow

### For AI Assistants

#### Starting a New Session
1. **Read** `INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md` to understand current status
2. **Check** `REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` to see current task
3. **Review** `INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md` for existing findings
4. **Continue** from the current task

#### During Investigation
1. **Investigate** the codebase systematically
2. **Document** findings immediately in `INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md`
3. **Update** `REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` as tasks complete
4. **Keep** `INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md` current with progress

#### Ending a Session
1. **Update** `INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md` with current status
2. **Update** `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` with accomplishments
3. **Mark** completed tasks in `REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md`
4. **Ensure** next AI can continue seamlessly

### For Humans

#### Checking Progress
- Look at `REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` for overall progress percentage
- Read `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` for recent accomplishments
- Check `INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md` for current status

#### Reviewing Findings
- Read `INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md` for detailed discoveries
- Check output directory for synthesized documentation

## Investigation Phases

The investigation is organized into 10 phases:

1. **Architecture & Structure** - Directory layout, file organization, entry points
2. **Core Abstractions** - Abstract base classes, interfaces, design contracts
3. **Type System** - Enums, dataclasses, type relationships
4. **Exception Hierarchy** - Error classes, error handling patterns
5. **Implementation Details** - Concrete implementations (Pacman, Yay, Paru)
6. **Factory Pattern** - Auto-detection, creation, manager selection
7. **Integration & Usage** - Common patterns, workflows, best practices
8. **Advanced Topics** - Security, performance, extensibility
9. **Documentation Synthesis** - Organize findings into final docs
10. **Validation & Review** - Completeness check, quality validation

---

## Output Structure

Final documentation will be created in `src/common/modules/package_manager/docs/` as:

```

## Handover Instructions

If you're an AI picking up this investigation:

1. **Start here:** Read this README to understand the system
2. **Then read:** `INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md` for current context
3. **Check progress:** `REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md` for current task
4. **Review findings:** `INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md` for what's been discovered
5. **Continue working:** Pick up from the current task

## Notes

- This investigation follows the methodology in `helpers/methodology/INVESTIGATION_METHODOLOGY.md`
- All helper documents should be kept up-to-date throughout the investigation
- The investigation is iterative - it's okay to revisit earlier phases
- Quality over speed - thorough documentation is the goal
- Any AI should be able to continue from any point
