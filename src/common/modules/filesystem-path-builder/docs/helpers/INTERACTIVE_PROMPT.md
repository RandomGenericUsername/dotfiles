## STATIC SECTION (Never Modified)

### Investigation Approach

This investigation follows a systematic, iterative methodology:

1. **Work Through Phases** - Complete 9 phases with 47 total tasks
2. **Document Continuously** - Record all findings in INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md
3. **Track Progress** - Update REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md as tasks complete
4. **Maintain Handover Readiness** - Keep this document current for session transitions

### How to Use These Documents

**INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md (this file):**
- Read this first when starting/continuing investigation
- Check DYNAMIC SECTION below for current status
- Follow the "Next Steps" to continue work

**REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md:**
- See all tasks and their status
- Track overall progress percentage
- Identify what's done and what's next

**INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md:**
- Read to understand all findings so far
- Add new discoveries as you investigate
- Organize by sections (architecture, API, usage, etc.)

**SESSION_SUMMARY.md:**
- Review to see what was accomplished recently
- Update at end of each session

**README.md:**
- Overview of the investigation system
- Workflow instructions
- Quality targets

### Workflow

1. Read this file (INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md) for current status
2. Check REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md for task details
3. Review INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md for existing findings
4. Continue investigation from current task
5. Document findings in INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md
6. Update REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md (mark tasks complete)
7. Update this file's DYNAMIC SECTION with progress
8. Update SESSION_SUMMARY.md when done

### Recent Accomplishments

- ✅ Completed all 47 investigation tasks
- ✅ Created comprehensive INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md (2652 lines)
- ✅ Documented all 4 classes (PathTree, PathsBuilder, ManagedPathTree, PathDefinition)
- ✅ Documented 30+ methods with examples

- ✅ Created troubleshooting guide (8 issues)
- ✅ Documented 8 integration points
- ✅ Exceeded all quality targets

### Next Steps

**Investigation is complete.** Ready for final documentation generation:

1. Create structured documentation in `docs/` directory
2. Organize by category:
   - `docs/architecture/` - Architecture documentation
   - `docs/api/` - API reference
   - `docs/guides/` - Usage guides
   - `docs/reference/` - Reference documentation
3. Generate final documentation files from INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md

### Context for Next Session

**Module Location:** `src/common/modules/filesystem-path-builder/`

**Module Structure (preliminary):**
```

**Key Classes Identified:**
- PathTree (dynamic navigation)
- PathsBuilder (explicit path building)
- ManagedPathTree (combines navigation + bulk creation)
- PathDefinition (dataclass for path configuration)

**Focus Areas:**
- Hidden directory support (dot-prefix)
- Dynamic attribute-based navigation
- Explicit path building pattern
- Integration with pathlib
- Type safety and immutability

**Investigation Goals:**
- Document all public APIs (100% coverage)
- Provide 50+ code examples
- Document 10+ usage patterns
- Create 5+ architecture diagrams
- Complete troubleshooting guide
- Document all integration points
