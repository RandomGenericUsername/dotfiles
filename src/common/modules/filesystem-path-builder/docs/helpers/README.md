**Purpose:** Entry point for AI sessions - provides current status and next steps

**Use this when:**
- Starting a new investigation session
- Continuing from where another AI left off
- Need to understand current progress

**Structure:**
- **STATIC SECTION:** Investigation approach (never changes)
- **DYNAMIC SECTION:** Current status, task, and next steps (updated each session)

---

### 2. **REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md** - Task Tracking
**Purpose:** Track all investigation tasks with status indicators

**Use this to:**
- See overall progress (percentage complete)
- Identify what's done and what's next
- Track tasks across all investigation phases

**Status Indicators:**
- ❌ Not Started
- 🔄 In Progress
- ✅ Complete

---

### 3. **INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md** - Detailed Findings
**Purpose:** Repository of all discoveries and documentation

**Contains:**
- Code examples
- Architecture diagrams
- API documentation
- Usage patterns
- Integration points
- Troubleshooting guides

**Target:** 2000-4000 lines of comprehensive findings

---

### 4. **SESSION_SUMMARY.md** - Session Accomplishments
**Purpose:** Summary of what was accomplished in each session

**Updated:**
- At the end of each investigation session
- When significant progress is made

**Contains:**
- Tasks completed
- Key discoveries
- Files created/modified
- Next steps

---

### 5. **README.md** - This File
**Purpose:** Guide to the investigation system

---

## Investigation Workflow

### For New Sessions:

1. **Read INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md** - Get current status
2. **Check REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md** - See what's done
3. **Review INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md** - Understand findings so far
4. **Continue investigation** - Pick up from current task
5. **Update all documents** - Keep everything current

### For Continuing Work:

1. **Update INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md** - Mark current task
2. **Investigate** - Explore the codebase
3. **Document in INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md** - Record findings
4. **Update REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md** - Mark tasks complete
5. **Repeat** - Continue systematically

### For Handovers:

1. **Update INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md** - Set context for next session
2. **Update SESSION_SUMMARY.md** - Record accomplishments
3. **Ensure INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md is current** - All findings documented
