## Investigation Approach

This investigation follows the **Iterative Investigation Methodology v1.0**. The approach is:

1. **Systematic** - Work through 10 phases sequentially
2. **Iterative** - Complete tasks one at a time
3. **Documented** - Record findings immediately
4. **Trackable** - Update progress continuously
5. **Handover-Ready** - Any AI can continue from any point

## How to Use Helper Documents

### INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md (This File)
- **Start here** every session
- Read DYNAMIC SECTION for current status
- Follow instructions for current task
- Update DYNAMIC SECTION when done

### REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
- Track all 53 tasks across 10 phases
- Mark tasks: ‚ùå Not Started | üîÑ In Progress | ‚úÖ Complete
- Check progress percentage
- Update after completing each task

### INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md
- Document ALL findings here
- Add code examples, diagrams, patterns
- Organize by section
- This becomes source for final docs

### SESSION_SUMMARY.md
- Record what you accomplished
- Note key discoveries
- List files created/modified
- Identify next steps

### README.md
- Overview of investigation system
- Workflow instructions
- Quick reference guide

## Workflow Instructions

### Starting Work
1. Read DYNAMIC SECTION below for current status
2. Check REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md for current task details
3. Review INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md for context
4. Begin investigating

### During Work
1. Examine codebase for current task
2. Document findings in INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md
3. Add code examples, diagrams, notes
4. Update REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md when task complete

### Ending Work
1. Update DYNAMIC SECTION with new status
2. Update SESSION_SUMMARY.md with accomplishments
3. Ensure all findings documented
4. Set clear instructions for next session

# DYNAMIC SECTION (Updated Each Session)

## Current Status

**Phase:** Phase 1 - Architecture & Structure Understanding
**Task:** 1.1 - Map directory structure
**Progress:** 0% (0 of 53 tasks complete)
**Session:** 1

## Current Task Details

**Task 1.1: Map directory structure**

Examine the logging module directory structure and document:
- All directories and their purposes
- File organization
- Module layout
- Package structure
- Entry points

**Expected Output in INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md:**
- Complete directory tree
- Purpose of each directory
- File listing with descriptions
- Module organization explanation

## Recent Accomplishments

**Session 1 (2025-10-29):**
- ‚úÖ Created helper documents directory
- ‚úÖ Created README.md
- ‚úÖ Created INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md
- ‚úÖ Created REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md (next)
- ‚úÖ Created INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md (next)
- ‚úÖ Created SESSION_SUMMARY.md (next)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Complete Task 1.1 - Map directory structure
2. **Then:** Task 1.2 - Identify all files and their purposes
3. **Then:** Task 1.3 - Understand module organization
4. **Then:** Task 1.4 - Identify public API surface
5. **Then:** Task 1.5 - Document entry points

## Context for Next Session

**What We Know:**
- Module location: `src/common/modules/logging`
- It's a standalone uv project
- Has tests directory with integration and interactive tests
- Has existing docs directory (may have some content)
- Uses pyproject.toml for configuration

**What We Need to Find:**
- Complete directory structure
- All source files
- Public API surface
- Core abstractions
- Type system
- Exception hierarchy
- Key features
- Integration patterns

**Focus Areas:**
- Rich library integration (based on test file names)
- Logging configuration
- Handler system
- Formatter system
- Integration with other dotfiles modules

## Instructions for Next AI Session

```
1. Read this DYNAMIC SECTION to understand current status

   - Use `view` tool to explore src/common/modules/logging
   - Document complete directory tree
   - Identify purpose of each directory
   - Add findings to INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md
4. Mark Task 1.1 complete in REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
5. Move to Task 1.2
6. Update this DYNAMIC SECTION when done
