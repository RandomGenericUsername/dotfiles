# Investigation System Guide

**Purpose:** This directory contains helper documents for the iterative investigation of the logging module.

**Created:** 2025-10-29
**Module:** `src/common/modules/logging`
**Methodology:** Based on the Iterative Investigation Methodology v1.0

---

## Overview

This investigation follows a systematic, iterative approach to fully document the logging module. The helper documents in this directory support:

1. **Progress Tracking** - Know exactly what's been done and what's next
2. **AI Handover** - Any AI can pick up where another left off
3. **Comprehensive Documentation** - Ensure nothing is missed
4. **Quality Assurance** - Meet documentation standards

---

## Helper Documents

### 1. README.md (This File)
**Purpose:** Explains the investigation system
**Use:** Read this first to understand the helper documents

### 2. INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md
**Purpose:** Entry point for AI sessions
**Use:** 
- Start here when beginning or continuing investigation
- Contains current status and next steps
- Updated after each work session
- Designed for AI handover

### 3. REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
**Purpose:** Track all investigation tasks
**Use:**
- See overall progress (percentage complete)
- Know which tasks are done/in-progress/pending
- Organized into 10 phases with 53 total tasks
- Mark tasks complete as you go

### 4. INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md
**Purpose:** Repository of all discoveries
**Use:**
- Document findings immediately
- Contains code examples, diagrams, patterns
- Source material for final documentation
- Organized by investigation area

### 5. SESSION_SUMMARY.md
**Purpose:** Summary of session accomplishments
**Use:**
- Track what was accomplished each session
- Record key discoveries
- Note files created/modified
- Identify next steps

---

## Workflow for AI Tools

### Starting a New Session

1. **Read INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md** - Get current status and instructions
2. **Check REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md** - See what's complete and what's next
3. **Review INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md** - Understand findings so far
4. **Begin work** - Start with the current task

### During Investigation

1. **Investigate** - Examine code, understand behavior
2. **Document** - Add findings to INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md immediately
3. **Update** - Mark tasks complete in REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
4. **Maintain** - Keep INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md current

### Ending a Session

1. **Update INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md** - Set status for next session
2. **Update SESSION_SUMMARY.md** - Record accomplishments
3. **Verify REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md** - Ensure progress is tracked
4. **Review INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md** - Ensure findings are documented

## Quick Start for AI

```
1. Read INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md
2. Check current phase and task
3. Investigate the codebase
4. Document findings in INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md
5. Update REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md
6. Update INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md for next session
```

---

## Handover Example

If you're picking up from another AI:

```
1. Read this README.md (you're here!)
2. Open INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md - see current status
3. Check REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md - see progress
4. Review INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md - understand findings
5. Continue from current task
```
