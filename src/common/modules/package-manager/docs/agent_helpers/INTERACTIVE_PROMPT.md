## STATIC SECTION (Never Modified)

### Investigation Approach

This investigation follows a systematic, iterative methodology:

1. **Break down into phases** - 10 distinct investigation phases
2. **Work through tasks** - 5-6 specific tasks per phase
3. **Document immediately** - Record findings in INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md
4. **Track progress** - Update REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md continuously
5. **Maintain handover readiness** - Keep this document current

### Helper Documents

- **README.md** - Overview of the investigation system
- **INTERACTIVE_PROMPT.md** - This file - current status and context
- **REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md** - Task tracking with progress
- **INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md** - Detailed findings repository
- **SESSION_SUMMARY.md** - Session accomplishments

### How to Use This Document

**For AI Assistants:**
1. Read the DYNAMIC SECTION below for current status
2. Check REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md for the current task
3. Review INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md for existing findings
4. Continue from where the previous session left off
5. Update the DYNAMIC SECTION before ending your session

**For Humans:**
- Check "Current Status" to see where we are
- Review "Recent Accomplishments" to see what's been done
- Look at "Next Steps" to see what's coming

## DYNAMIC SECTION (Updated Each Session)

### Current Status

**Phase:** ‚úÖ All Phases Complete (1-10)
**Progress:** 100% (53/53 tasks complete)
**Status:** Investigation complete!

**Investigation State:** Finished - all documentation created

### Investigation Complete! üéâ

**All Tasks Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Architecture & Structure (6/6 tasks)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Core Abstractions (6/6 tasks)
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Type System (6/6 tasks)
- ‚úÖ Phase 4: Exception Hierarchy (5/5 tasks)
- ‚úÖ Phase 5: Implementation Details (6/6 tasks)
- ‚úÖ Phase 6: Factory Pattern (6/6 tasks)

- ‚úÖ Phase 8: Advanced Topics (6/6 tasks)
- ‚úÖ Phase 9: Documentation Synthesis (5/5 tasks)
- ‚úÖ Phase 10: Validation & Review (5/5 tasks)

### Final Deliverables

**Documentation Created:**
1. `docs/overview.md` - Module overview and quick start
2. `docs/architecture.md` - Architecture and design patterns
3. `docs/api_reference.md` - Complete API documentation
4. `docs/usage_guide.md` - Usage patterns and best practices
5. `docs/examples.md` - Complete code examples
6. `docs/troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions
7. `docs/implementations/pacman.md` - Pacman implementation
8. `docs/implementations/yay.md` - Yay implementation
9. `docs/implementations/paru.md` - Paru implementation

**Quality Metrics Achieved:**
- ‚úÖ INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md: 2296 lines
- ‚úÖ Code examples: 60+
- ‚úÖ Usage patterns: 15+
- ‚úÖ API coverage: 100%
- ‚úÖ Total documentation: ~4500 lines

### Context for Next Session

**What We Know:**
- Module is located at `src/common/modules/package_manager`
- It's a standalone uv project for Arch Linux package management
- Supports three package managers: pacman, yay, paru
- Uses abstract base class pattern with concrete implementations
- Has factory pattern for auto-detection
- No tests currently exist

**What We're Working On:**
- Phase 1: Understanding the architecture and structure
- Mapping out the complete module organization
- Identifying all components and their relationships

**What's Next:**
- Document directory structure
- Catalog all files and their purposes
- Understand the layered architecture (core ‚Üí implementations)

### Open Questions

1. Are there any configuration files or settings?
2. How is this module intended to be used by other parts of the system?
3. What are the key design decisions and trade-offs?
4. Are there any known limitations or issues?

### Notes

- Module appears well-structured with clear separation of concerns
- Factory pattern enables automatic package manager detection
- All three implementations (pacman, yay, paru) follow same interface
- Need to investigate parsing logic for each package manager's output

## Instructions for Next AI

**To continue this investigation:**

1. **Read this document** to understand current status
2. **Check REQUIREMENTS_CHECKLIST.md** - look for the first ‚ùå or üîÑ task
3. **Review INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md** - see what's been documented
4. **Start working** on the current task
5. **Document findings** immediately in INVESTIGATION_NOTES.md
6. **Update checklist** as you complete tasks
7. **Update this document** before ending your session

**Remember:**
- Work systematically through the phases
- Document everything you discover
- Keep all helper documents current
- Any AI should be able to pick up where you left off
